How did the Millennium Falcon get from Hoth to Bespin without their hyperdrive? Are these locations so close together? I would think not, because Hoth is in the Hoth Sysem and Bespin is in the Bespin System.

The asteroid field in ESB does seem to be in the Hoth System so there is not really an issue there.

I&#39;ve looked on this site and on the Wookieepedia but I&#39;ve yet to find a canon answer. This appears to be such a large plot hole, that there simple *must* be a canon (EU) explanation.

"[Hoth](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Hoth)", *wikia.com*

"[Bespin](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Bespin)", *wikia.com*

"[Hoth asteroid field](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Hoth_asteroid_field)", *wikia.com*

There is a barely-satisfactory theory here: "[Untitled Document](http://mannveille.com/tim/world-of-tim/plotprobs.html)", *mannveille.com* but that does not appear to be endorsed by canon.
